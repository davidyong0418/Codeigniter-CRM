                    One of the most common digital advertising models is PPC, which stands for pay-per-click.  PPC is a model of internet marketing in which advertisers pay a fee each time one of their ads is clicked. It works quickly to buy visits to client’s site, rather than attempting to “earn” those visits organically.  PPC is encompassing of many forms of advertising such text ads, banner ads, video ads, targeted ads, and retargeting ads (ads shown to people that have previously engaged with you).  The two primary platforms for managed ads are the search engines (such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo) and social media (such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Pinterest).

                    The frequency in which an ad is shown, and where it’s positioned, depends on your bid (just like an auction) per click, your daily budget, your monthly budget, and the same for all the competitors bidding on the same key words.  The cost of each click is dependent upon supply & demand (competition), click-through rates, as well as quality scores for the ads and the pages websites they direct you to.  Another reason a well-built website is so important is because the better the quality, the lower the cost per click, and therefore the better ROI.

                    This platform allows advertisers to bid for ad placement in a search engine whenever someone searches on a keyword that is related to their business offering.  This user is actively searching for a product or service.  Every time the ad is clicked, sending a visitor to the client’s website, the client has to pay the search engine a small fee.  If the ad is shown, but not clicked, the client pays nothing.

                    <span>-</span>
                    Based on your average sales, the PPC ROI (return on investemnt) can be easily and specifically calculated. FOr exampole, if the average click costs you $3, and you have a 2% converstaion rate (1 out of every 50 clicks results in a sale), then teh customer acquisition cost for taht keyword is $150 ($3 x 50 clicks to get one customer). If the average customer earns you $220, you would profit $70 ($220 sale - $150 in clicks), so you get a 47% ROI.
