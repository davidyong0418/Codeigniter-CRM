                Social media has grown into a multi-billion dollar industry; it's nearly impossible to walk in public and not find people glued to their phones, engaging with social media.  Social media has changed the world, and continues to do so, replacing the way people learn, find, and communicate with each other and with companies.  
                <br/>
                For this reason, SMM works very well as stand-alone marketing strategy as well as a significant fortifier to an SEO strategy - providing "social proofing" that people and search engines both like.  There are two approaches to marketing on social media; organic interaction and paid advertising (covered in Managed Digital Advertising).
