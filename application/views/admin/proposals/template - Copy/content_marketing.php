            In the United States, one of the highest possible forms of establishing credibility is the publishing of a book.  Being a published author instantly increases the credibility and authority of the author.  In today's digital world, we are able to accomplish the same with the publishing of digital content.  
            <br/>
            Content marketing also provides another avenue for search engine traffic for people at different stages of the buying process.  For example, someone that searches for “{Buyer Searches field from Industry CM Table}” is much closer to making a buying decision than someone that searches for “{Explorer Searches field from Industry CM Table}”.  By generating the additional content on your website, you provide additional “points of entry” to your website, besides your home page.  Visitors will find the article on your website in response to their search queries and then frequently view other pages on your website, gaining exposure to your content and moving closer to taking action.

                Create content that establishes your credibility and increases your authority in your industry.   The content should be created in simple terms that are comprehensible to your target audiences and titled in a manner that invites engagement, provokes curiosity, and/or attracts search engine traffic.  Once content is created, it should be posted to your blog, and promoted across all social media channels and content sharing platforms.  Below you will find a list of example  topics and titles that will engage your intended audience.
