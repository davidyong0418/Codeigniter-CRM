         <h3>ANALYSIS OF YOUR WEBSITE</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="card-body">
         <h4 class="custom-color">PURPOSE</h4>
         <p class="card-text">
            A website serves one primary purpose, to generate business. In order to do that, a website must accomplish two specific things: 
         </p>
         <ol>
            <li>
               <strong>BE FOUND BY SEARCH ENGINES</strong><span>-</span>To be found the by search engines, the website coded according to industry best standards, contain the appropriate content, and engage the human visitors.  Search engines will read your website code, use a complex algorithm to determine where your website should rank, then monitor and gage human behavior on your website to validate what it believes (its algorithm).  
            </li>
            <li>
               One example of this is how long a human stays on a website after arriving at it.  If many humans continue to leave the website right away, the search engines will assume the website's user experience is poor OR the content is not relevant to the search terms they typed in.  On the other hand, if humans stay on the website longer and seem to engage with it more, search engines assume it's high quality and relevant.  Search engines "make their living" on showing the most relevant content to people for the search terms people type in.  So, good sites with positive human behavior get rewarded, bad sites with negative human behavior get penalized.
            </li>
            <li>
               This is why your website must be expertly designed for people and coded for search engines.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>CONVERT VISITORS INTO PAYING CUSTOMERS</strong>
               <span>-</span>
               According to Entrepreneur Magazine, up to 83% of consumers visit a company’s website before making a spending decision.  Your website is the final destination for most of online and offline marketing efforts.  Furthermore, a website is often the first impression made upon a potential client, so it must be engaging, concisely informative, visually appealing, and with strong calls-to-action in order to convert a visitor into a customer.
            </li>
         </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="card-body">
         <h4 class="custom-color">TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT</h4>
         <p class="card-tex">
            There are many things your website is doing well, however the areas below should be improved if SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is a point of concern.  Your web developer should be able to correct most of these with relative ease.
         </p>
         <ol>
            <li>
               <strong>PAGE LOAD SPEED</strong>
               <span>-</span>
               The page load speed not only affects the user experience, but Google has specifically declared that it would penalize a website ranking based on page load ⦁	speed, user experience, and ⦁	mobile⦁	 ⦁	friendliness (you can click on any words to see Google’s official declarations).  Your overall speed, user experience, and mobile friendliness are all poor in Google’s eyes.  The scores below are provided by Google, and a link to official page is included so you can verify it.
               <ul>
                  <li>Desktop Speed Score - 50 out of 100 (according to Google Page Speed Insights(link))</li>
                  <li>Mobile Speed Score - 41 out of 100 (according to Google Page Speed Insights(link))</li>
                  <li>Mobile User Experience - 65 out of 100 (according to Google Page Speed Insights(link))</li>
                  <li>Failed Google’s mobile friendly test  (according to Google Mobile Friendly Test(link))</li>
               </ul>

               <strong>NO MINIFICATION OF JS & CSS</strong>
               <span>-</span>
               Minifying these files can help increase your page load speed. (verified by Google Page Speed Insights(link)
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong> PAGE CACHING NOT LEVERAGED</strong>
               <span>-</span>
               Your website is not leveraging browser caching.  Caching your pages will decrease their loading time by storing them temporarily on the user’s device. The caching delay has to be set depending on the page updating frequency.  Since your website content rarely changes, page caching is highly recommended. (verified by Google Page Speed Insights (link))
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>PAGE CAXHING NOT ALLOWED</strong>
               <span>-</span>
               Your website does not allow page caching.  Caching your pages will decrease their loading time by storing them temporarily on the user’s device. The caching delay has to be set depending on the page updating frequency.  Since your website content rarely changes, page caching is highly recommended.

               <strong>HEAVY IMAGES </strong>
               <span>-</span>
               Heavy images (big file size) lower your page load time and the page load grade.  Your web page contains ___ heavy images (verified by Google Page Speed Insights (link))
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>EXTREME NUMBER OF WEBSITES ON SAME SERVER & IP </strong>
               <span>-</span>
               There are 300 other sites hosted on this server. If any one site on the server is compromised, it opens a gateway for the attacker to gain access to the other sites hosted on the same server as well. The higher the number of sites on a server the higher the risk.  There is also great SEO benefit in a low-share or dedicated server.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>MANY W3C ERRORS</strong>
               <span>-</span>
               An HTML document must be valid to be fully compatible and readable by browsers and robots, yours has 59 errors.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>TEXT TO CODE RATIO IS TOO LOW </strong>
               <span>-</span>
               Only 0.05% of your page content is text.  The text/code ratio is used to determine the quality of a page. The higher the ratio is, the more important the content will be. Acceptable ranges are between 25% - 75%.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>USE OF FLASH</strong>
               <span>-</span>
               While it often looks nicer, Flash content can't be properly indexed by search engines and challenges your SEO efforts.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>NO 404 PAGE</strong>
               <span>-</span>
               404 error pages are displayed when the page you are trying to open can't be found on the site's server for a variety of reasons.  If someone visits a page on your website that doesn’t exist, they should be redirected to the home page or a 404 page that provides them useful information.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>PRINTING STYLE SHEET IS MISSING </strong>
               <span>-</span>
               A dedicated style sheet for printing allows users to print the content of your website in a more readable way. It is especially important if you are creating content that you want your website visitors to consume, such as blog articles and ‘how-to’ articles.  Even if your user may never print anything, having the style sheet is viewed favorably by the search engines.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>NO HTML COMPRESSION </strong>
               <span>-</span>
               You should compress your HTML to reduce your page size and page loading times - this will help your site retain visitors and increase page views. If you were using compression, you could be compressing your HTML size by 63 % - from 15.04 Kb to 5.52 Kb which would further reduce your page loading time.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>DEPRECATED HTML ELEMENTS</strong>
               <span>-</span>
               A deprecated element is one that has been outdated by newer constructs. Deprecated elements may become obsolete in future versions of HTML, so it is highly recommended not to use them.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>NOT USING SCHEMA</strong>
               <span>-</span>

            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>NO OPEN GRAPH </strong>
               <span>-</span>
               Open Graph is a term created by Facebook developers to describe the ability for some social networking software to interact across different platforms. This allows different websites and applications to share information about a user, their interests and even their friendship network.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>NO USE OF HEADING TAGS </strong>
               <span>-</span>
               Heading Tags are used in order to provide both your visitors and the search engine with a clear view about the content’s importance.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>MANY IMAGES NOT USING ALT TAGS </strong>
               <span>-</span>
               Alternative text describes your images so they can appear in image search results, be cached by the search engine bots (they cannot read images), and be read to blind users.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>CONFIGURE IMAGE ALT TEXT</strong>
               <span>-</span>
               You have several images without alt attributes. The alt attribute of an image element informs the search engine of its description. Choose your keywords carefully to be indexed in Image SERPs. The length of the alternative text should be more than 80 characters. This attribute is also used by assistance software to describe images for blind people.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>UNTITLED PAGE </strong>
               <span>-</span>
               Page titles appear in search results and at the top of the browser's window when visiting the site. Appropriate page titles are particularly important for search engine optimization.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>IMAGE ALT TAGS MISSING </strong>
               <span>-</span>
               Alternative text (the alt attribute) is missing for 1 of 4 images we found on your website (___________).  Search engine crawlers cannot actually "see" images, so the alternative text attribute allows you to assign a specific description to each image. They are also used by screen readers to help provide some context for the visually impaired.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>TITLE TAG NOT OPTIMIZED </strong>
               <span>-</span>
               Your title tag is not well optimized for any service related keywords.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>META TAG DESCRIPTION MISSING</strong>
               <span>-</span>
               The meta-description tag is missing from your page. You should include this tag in order to provide a brief description of your page which can be used by search engines or directories.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>NO KEYWORDS</strong>
               <span>-</span>
               There are not meta keywords defined for any of your website's pages.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>TOO MANY LINKED CSS FILES (13)</strong>
               <span>-</span>
               When possible it is recommended to combine your CSS files in one single file (or close) to lower the number of HTTP requests.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>TOO MANY SCRIPTS IN THE FOOTER (40)</strong>
               <span>-</span>
               You have 40 scripts at the footer of your website. This can negatively impact the loading time of your site and it creates significant hacking vulnerabilities. This is often an indicator of having too many plugins (like apps for your website) which can cause a litany of problems such as website crashes, poor website performance, and security breaches.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>META ROBOTS.TXT IS MISSING</strong>
               <span>-</span>
               When missing, search engines index every page of your website (not desired and not safe).
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>SITEMAP NOT XML</strong>
               <span>-</span>
               you have a sitemap link, but it is not an XML Sitemap which helps search engines know about all the pages on your site that you want them to know about.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>⦁	NEED A SITEMAP </strong>
               <span>-</span>
               A sitemap is a file containing an ordered organization of the linking structure of your website. This file is not only used to define the importance you attach to each page, but also to help the search engines crawl your entire website. The location of the sitemap must be defined in the robots.txt file.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>INTERNAL LINKS NOT SEO FRIENDLY</strong>
               <span>-</span>
               Links on your website have not been optimized for search engines.  Links such as ___________  place key words in the URL that do not correspond to your service keywords and the link structure pushes the beneficial keywords (limo buses) further from the domain name.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>NO FAVICON</strong>
               <span>-</span>
               The Favicon is a small icon associated with a website. The Favicon is important because it is displayed next to the website's URL in the address bar of the browser as well as in bookmarks and shortcuts.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>NO ANALYTICS INSTALLED</strong>
               <span>-</span>
               Web analytics let you measure visitor activity on your website. You should have at least one analytics tool installed, but It can also be good to install a second in order to cross-check the data.  Popular Analytics Tools Include: Google Analytics, & Quantcast.

         <p class="card-text">
            The following areas do not require any coding or technical knowledge to correct.  Instead, they pertain to the marketing and web design best practices to improve user experience and conversion optimization (the number of website visitors that convert into customers instead of abandoning the site).

               The company name doesn’t indicate that you are in the _____  industry .  Therefore, your messaging must be extremely clear as early as possible. A new website visitor should never be left asking the question “What do you do??”.

               <strong>OVER-NESTED CONTENT</strong>
               <span>-</span>
               Industry best practices since 2004 have recommended, backed by research, that for non-ecommerce websites like yours, all content should be reachable with minimal number of clicks.  It is recommended that you rearrange content and navigation to make every piece of content reachable within one click, whenever possible. Where not possible, such as with extensive blog content, then it two clicks should be the maximum.  Gathering detailed information, such as the attorney bio’s and service details on your website currently requires up to 3 clicks for the website visitor.

            <li>
               <strong>NO BLOG</strong>
               <span>-</span>
               You do not have a blog that is regularly updated to educate your website visitors and show your expertise in your field.  Additionally, writing a blog can also help you get more search engine traffic (see the content marketing section for details).

            <li>
               <strong>POSSIBLE MIS-TARGETING</strong>
               <span>-</span>
               Your website and/or blog contains titles & subject that do not match audience search queries, expected information, or uses excessive jargon and industry-specific acronyms for your target visitor.  Unless it is for your peers, your website content must be of interest to your specific audience you are trying to attract to your website.  It should serve as a resource so that it demonstrates your expertise, increases credibility, addresses pain points and concerns, and attracts greater traffic from the desired target audiences.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>UNCLEAR VERBIAGE</strong>
               <span>-</span>
               The clearer the content is on your website, the more likely it is to yield desired results.  There are instances throughout your website where verbiage is unclear, such as the second sentence in the following paragraph on the ⦁ link page
               <p>We can review your circumstances and help to plan beneficial tax opportunities for you. It may be looking at a current transaction or your assets as a whole. You may be able to structure transactions to allow deferral of taxes or decrease the amount.</p>

               <strong>NOT ADDRESSING PAIN POINT</strong>
               <span>-</span>
               Every industry has negative biases and reasons why people hesitate, dislike, or refrain from engaging with a business or industry. Common pain points include price to value perception, overwhelming  or confusing processes, lack of industry trust, and so on.  It is important to first understand all the reason someone may not engage with your business, then mitigate, dispel, and/or address in business practices and in all your messaging.

            <li>
               <strong>VACANT OR NEAR-VACANT PAGES</strong>
               <span>-</span>
               Pages such as those listed below are blank or contain no more than single-line statements with less than twenty words.  These types of pages may frustrate visitors and typically fail to provide sufficient information to answer the questions or concerns of the visitors
               <ul>
                  <li>link</li>
                  <li>link</li>

            <li>
               <strong>DUPLICATE CONTENT</strong>
               <span>-</span>
               Search engines notoriously penalize duplicate content.  There are several pages on your website that have identical duplicate content, such as:
               <ul>
                  <li>link</li>
                  <li>link</li>

            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>SAME IMAGES USED ON MULTIPLE PAGES</strong>
               <span>-</span>
               Images on pages should be used to summarize, augment, aesthetically enhance, or facilitate the consumption of content on a page.  Images such as the one shown, are repeated on multiple pages throughout your website and are not adding value to the content.  When value isn’t added, the images become superfluous and possibly frustrating to visitors.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>CONTENT PLACED “BELOW THE FOLD”</strong>
               <span>-</span>
               Due to the dramatically increased consumption of websites on mobile devices, even desktop consumption has become dramatically more scroll-oriented.  This means that the most valuable space on your website is “above-the-fold”, the term utilized describe the space at the top of a web page that is viewable before scrolling. Various studies demonstrate that content consumption drastically declines when visitors must scroll or click, unless the content above the fold is strong enough to illicit the scroll behavior.  The space above the fold is not being utilized effectively on your website.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>MISSPELLING</strong>

               Two different email addresses are listed on the website.  You should get rid of the Verizon one.  If it’s the one you check more often, forward the info@screen-solutions.com email to the Verizon.

               <strong>NOT USING A BRANDED EMAIL</strong>
               <span>-</span>
               Using generic and free emails, like livyos@gmail.com, are not as professional and trust-building as using an email that matches your website domain, such as info@livyos.com because anyone can create a gmail address to impersonate your company, such as livyoscatering@gmail.com.

               <strong>VALUE-BUILDING CONTENT</strong>
               <span>-</span>
               A sale cannot be made unless value exceeds price and a prospect is confident in the service provider.  Your website should prominently display your competitive advantages and address pain points that a prospective client may have. They should answer questions like: Why you? What’s different here? What can you claim or demonstrate to put prospects mind at ease?
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>LACK OF FAQ </strong>
               <span>-</span>
               One the most effect ways of helping your website visitor is to include FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) conte0nt.  FAQs facilitate the decision-making process while demonstrating expertise and allow you to address specific pain points or concerns that the visitor may have.

               <strong>CONTENT FORMATTING </strong>
               <span>-</span>
               Your website contains a lot of very valuable information.  Unfortunately, the more information a website contains the less likely a visitor is to actually read it unless the content is made more easily consumable, such as utilizing bullet points, strategic font bolding, and visual coloring techniques.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>UNVETTED TESTIMONIALS</strong>
               <span>-</span>
               Testimonials on a website are often believed to be fabricated unless otherwise vetted, such as is the case when they are written in Google or Facebook. For this reason, it is more effective to provide consumers with an easily accessible third-party review such as reviews embedded from the most statistically trusted sources: Google and Facebook.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>NO EMBEDED REVIEWS </strong>
               <span>-</span>
               Google or Facebook reviews have very high credibility because of the reviewer verification features inherent to the both platforms. You have sufficient reviews on one or both of these platforms that embedding the reviews on your website would dramatically improve trust and credibility. 
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>ABSENT SOCIAL MEDIA LINKS </strong>
               <span>-</span>
               Your website does not connect visitors to your social media pages.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>DISCOUNTING </strong>
               <span>-</span>
               Discounting your services only attracts price sensitive buyers, which commonly are the most difficult customers.  Discounting also conflicts with the target market for executive transportation services.  Instead of discount price, consider adding upgrades.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>OBSCURE CALLS TO ACTION </strong>
               <span>-</span>
               Call-to-action (CTA) buttons should be obvious, clear in their verbiage, and easy to read and see.  Website visitors need multiple, highly visible, directive or suggestive calls to action such as “Call now for _____” or “start your _____ today”
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>MISSING BUSINESS ADDRESS </strong>
               <span>-</span>
               Even though your business does not service clients from your office location, providing a business address on the website is considered to be a significant factor in consumer trust building.  Furthermore, the map used on the "contact us" page may be interpreted as your service area, thereby limiting contact requests outside the area highlighted on the map.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>ABSENCE OF MEDIA </strong>
               <span>-</span>
               Consider adding photos or videos of _______________ to help further assist customers in making purchase decisions.  As best as possible, photos & videos should be personalized to your company and should support the other content on the page.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>MEDIA DOESN’T SUPPORT MESSAGING </strong>
               <span>-</span>
               The images on your website may create more confusion than clarity.  Images should support the accompanying content to reinforce the message and/or visually enhance content.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>NO STRONG USP </strong>
               <span>-</span>
               The USP (unique selling proposition) is the essence of what makes your product or service better than competitors. In online marketing, communicating your USP clearly and quickly is one of the keys to getting customers to convert on your site. If the company name is removed from your website, the claim or selling proposition should be unique enough to be associated with your company. 
               <br/>
               Unfortunately, the “quality”, “honesty”, and “value” currently used are also used by many companies.  Additionally, these words must be demonstrated in order to be effective, for example by using reviews, ratings, and pricing.  While this might be an extreme example, a USP such as “We guarantee your project will be completed on time or we will reduce the by 2% per month” is so bold and unique that no other competitor would dare to use it and it would give you a strong position in the marketplace.

            <strong class="custom-color">SUMMARY</strong>
            <span>-</span>
            It does not matter how much money is spent on marketing if the website people are being directed to fails to convert them into clients (called “conversion”).  The process of increasing conversion rates is a function of website optimization, whereby an analysis of a website’s design, layout, navigation, content, and targeting are optimized to improve user experience, calls-to-action, and ultimately increased sales.  An increase in conversion as small as 1% can increase sales by as 40% in the average website (world-wide average conversion is 2.43%).  There is no single more effective way to increase sales from your digital presence and increase the return on marketing investment than to increase your conversion rate.

            <span>-</span>
            If your budget is tight, provide the list above to your current web person or team and use it as a checklist to correct your website to the best of their abilities. However, considering the volume of technical (and non-technical) issues on your website, you should strongly consider rebuilding your website to ensure it is built correctly both from a coding and a marketing stand point. 
         </p>
         <p>When we build a site, not only is it coded to latest standards, but it is also built (from a coding standpoint) to easily adapt to future changes.  From a marketing perspective, we build persuasive websites by understanding first who is visiting your website and then why they are there.  One of the biggest website conversion issues companies have is delivering the wrong information to the wrong visitors.  We will create content that answers the visitors' questions, lay it out to target to the correct audience, and deliver the content in the best medium.</p>
      </div>
      <p>In an easily commoditized industry, where so many companies provide the same products in services, we help you define your competitive advantages in terms of clear and relatable benefits your visitors can understand.  We'll layout the content so that within the first 3 seconds of visiting your website, your prospective client knows the competitive difference of using your company.  This is how we capture people’s interest and justify (in their minds) the additional effort to contact you or read further and collect information.
