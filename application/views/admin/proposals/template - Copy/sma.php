                Unlike search engine advertising, social media ads are not commonly (though they can be) targeted based on the keywords searched.  Instead, social media ads are targeted to the user data available to the platform.  Therefore, ads can be very narrowly targeted to a specific audience type, such as 35-40 year-old males that earn $60k per year, are married, and have interest in football and fishing.  The trade-off with search engine advertising is that the users seeing ads because of who they are, not what they searched.  There are many different subcategories of ads in social media but the fundamental benefit them all is to place your ads in front of people that are not actively looking for your products or services.

                <span>-</span>
                Based on your average sales, the PPC ROI (return on investemnt) can be easily and specifically calculated. FOr exampole, if the average click costs you $3, and you have a 2% converstaion rate (1 out of every 50 clicks results in a sale), then teh customer acquisition cost for taht keyword is $150 ($3 x 50 clicks to get one customer). If the average customer earns you $220, you would profit $70 ($220 sale - $150 in clicks), so you get a 47% ROI.
